    <p>A holiday at LinguaMeeting is defined as a day off students receive during the academic calendar.
        <strong>For example: MLK Day, Labor Day, or Columbus Day.</strong>
        Holidays are separate from academic breaks.
        <strong>For example, spring break or winter break should not be listed here.</strong>

    <p><strong>Important:</strong> LinguaMeeting sessions will be held during school holidays.
        We use this information to notify students when a booked session may fall on a "holiday" designated by the instructor.
