                <span class="fw-bold d-block">Welcome to LinguaMeeting Experiences!</span> This is an opportunity for students to participate in Zoom style events, hosted by LinguaMeeting coaches, offering diverse
                cultural opportunities in the target language. Examples include a personalized concert by a Spanish-guitar-playing host, to an Elote de Maiz cooking class by a
                Honduran chef, to a walking tour of Sevilla. These multi-media live events are adapted to engage first and second-year language learners in fun, low-stakes,
                cultural immersion, and provide the opportunity to connect with communities around the world.
