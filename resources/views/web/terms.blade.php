                                Through this site, we provide foreign language coaching services, which include Spanish, French, Italian, Chinese, Arabic, Portuguese and Russian. The Services will be provided to the students through real time conference meetings between the coach and the student in sessions with a minimum of 1 student and a maximum of 4 students per session. Service is implemented through web-based software. Students will be responsible for having the technical requirements to access the online LinguaMeeting sessions.

                                LinguaMeeting offers two types of sessions: small-group (1-4) and one-on-one sessions.

                                The scheduled sessions depend on each school. All sessions will be scheduled between 8:00 a.m. and 11:00 p.m. Eastern Standard Time.

                                Rescheduling: The student can change the scheduled session at any time and as many times as needed. IN the case the student has missed the session, the student should be aware that the make-up session applies to the course instruction regarding that same week. 
                            </p>

                                Make-up sessions: A make-up credit can be used only after the student has missed a session. After it has been activated, it can be canceled (a minimum of 5 hours before the session start time) and reused another time. If a student misses the make-up session, the make-up credit cannot be applied to another session. For make ups to be available to students, the professor must select the option to offer make-up sessions for purchase in the coaching form. The selections made in the coaching form will be applied to your specific course.
